## Compilation
- Your code will be compiled this way:  
`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c`  
- As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)
- Our main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h
- You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf. Example of test file that you could use:
